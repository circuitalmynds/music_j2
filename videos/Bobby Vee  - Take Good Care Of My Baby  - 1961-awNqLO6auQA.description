This was Bobby Vee's first and only #1 hit. Released on August 7th,1961, it immediately began to climb up the Billboard Charts, and by September 18th, 1961 it had reached #1, staying there for three weeks. It is no surprise, given it was written by the legendary Brill Building songwriting team of Gerry Goffin and Carole King, the song featured an irresistible melody along with inspired and sincere lyrics. Add to that an equally sincere and strong vocal performance by Bobby Vee and you have one of the greatest hits of all time. 

I had the pleasure and honor of meeting Bobby Vee after a show four years ago,  and he took the time to talk to my wife and I, and to sign a rare EP from Barcelona, Spain. He even commented that he had never seen it before. He also signed other items and took pictures, showing us what a kind and down-to-earth guy he really is. I'm glad I got the opportunity to shake his hand and to thank him for all the musical pleasure he had provided us over the years. So in his honor I give you this humble video.
